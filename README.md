# Chihuhua vs Muffin
This is a University Project which implements the training, evalutaion and usage of Convolutional Neural Networks which Binary differentiate between a picture of a chihuahua and a Blueberry Muffin.
## A Convoluted Binary Classifier
As this is a University Project it will no longer be maintained by me.

# Features
- Train, evaluate and use a new Model with tensoflow (Own_Model)
- Train, evaluate and use the MobileNetV2 with transfer learning

# How to Run
- For the own Model:
  -> Run BuildModel_Own.py
  -> Run GUI_Own.py
- For the Transfer Learning Model of MobileNetV2
  -> Run BuildModel_MN2.py
  -> Run GUI_MN2.py
